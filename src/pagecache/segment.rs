//! The `SegmentAccountant` is an allocator for equally-
//! sized chunks of the underlying storage file (segments).
//!
//! It must maintain these critical safety properties:
//!
//! A. We must not overwrite existing segments when they
//!    contain the most-recent stable state for a page.
//! B. We must not overwrite existing segments when active
//!    threads may have references to `LogId`'s that point
//!    into those segments.
//!
//! To complicate matters, the `PageCache` only knows
//! when it has put a page into an IO buffer, but it
//! doesn't keep track of when that IO buffer is
//! stabilized (until write coalescing is implemented).
//!
//! To address these safety concerns, we rely on
//! these techniques:
//!
//! 1. We delay the reuse of any existing segment
//!    by ensuring there are at least <# io buffers>
//!    freed segments in front of the newly freed
//!    segment in the free list. This ensures that
//!    any pending IO buffer writes will hit
//!    stable storage before we overwrite the
//!    segment that may have contained the previous
//!    latest stable copy of a page's state.
//! 2. we use a `epoch::Guard::defer()` that guarantees
//!    any segment that has been logically freed
//!    or emptied by the `PageCache` will have its
//!    addition to the free segment list be delayed
//!    until any active threads that were acting on
//!    the shared state have checked-out.
//!
//! Another concern that arises due to the fact that
//! IO buffers may be written out-of-order is the
//! correct recovery of segments. If there is data
//! loss in recently written segments, we must be
//! careful to preserve linearizability in the log.
//! To do this, we must detect "torn segments" that
//! were not able to be fully written before a crash
//! happened. We detect torn individual segments by
//! writing a lsn-tagged pad to the end of the
//! segment, filling any unused space.
//!
//! But what if we wrote a later segment before we
//! were able to write its immediate predecessor segment,
//! and then a crash happened? We must preserve
//! linearizability, so we must not recover the later
//! segment when its predecessor was lost in the crash.
//!
//! 3. This case is solved again by having a concept of
//!    an "unstable tail" of segments that, during recovery,
//!    must appear consecutively among the recovered
//!    segments with the highest LSN numbers. We
//!    prevent reuse of segments while they remain in
//!    this "unstable tail" by only allowing them to be
//!    reallocated after another later segment has written
//!    a "stable consecutive lsn" into its own header
//!    that is higher than ours.
